        <p>At <strong>BookHub</strong>, your satisfaction is our priority, and we want you to be delighted with every purchase. However, if for any reason you're not completely satisfied with your order, our flexible return policy makes it easy for you to return your items.</p>

        <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> <strong>Return Window : </strong> We offer a 30-day return window from the date of delivery. During this period, you can return any eligible items for a full refund or exchange, provided the item is in its original condition.</p>

        <p><strong>Eligibility Criteria : </strong>To qualify for a return, the book must be in its original condition, without signs of use or damage, and returned in its original packaging. Please note that certain items, such as digital products or sale items, may be non-returnable, and we recommend reviewing the product page for any specific return information.</p>

        <p><strong>How to Return : </strong> To initiate a return, simply contact our customer service team at <a href="#">support@bookhub.com</a> or call us at +94 71 110 2929.

Please ensure the item is securely packaged before returning it to avoid any damage during transit.</p>

        <p><strong>Refund Process : </strong>Once we receive your return, our team will inspect the item and notify you of the refund status. Approved returns will be refunded within 7-10 business days to your original payment method. Please note that the cost of return shipping may be deducted from your refund unless the return is due to a BookHub error</p>
